	<strong class="big">ctrl</strong> is designed to help individuals living with ADHD or other mental 
	health issues that cause executive dysfunction, accomplish tasks using chance.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>here's how to use it!</strong> fill out the text field with a task you're wanting to complete. you can add as many tasks
	as there are sides to the dice (shown in the 'dice size' dropdown). once all of your tasks are filled in, set the priority level for each task - the higher your number,
	the wider the range and the more important the task. be sure to make one of your tasks something fun/rewarding!
</p>
<p>
	 once the 'remainder' reads as zero, you may roll the dice to pick which task you will complete. 
</p>
<p>
	the dice will pick a number - look for the task with the range that this number falls in: this denotes the selected task. start on your task immediately! don't argue with the
	dice or roll again - just get up and do it! and if you happen to roll for your fun task? that's wonderful! make sure to leave space for youself to enjoy this time with no shame.
</p>
